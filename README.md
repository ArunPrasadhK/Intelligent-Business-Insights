Prediction and visualization of areas for business operations improvement

Given the data on a landscaping company, our main goal was to identify possible areas of improvement for the
Company. This could be in terms of revenue, customer satisfaction, or time taken to complete certain jobs.
To achieve this broke down the analysis below
• Understanding the revenue breakdown and establishing if there is a pattern.
• Evaluating if the Company is utilizing all its resources judicially, including the lead time between the
requested date and completion date, and employee work schedules.
• Exploring the potential correlation between customer satisfaction, lead time, and geographic location.
